Pipe it up PJ
Nostalgia
T house up north or near the coast, rudeboy, there's both
Spend this bread on jewels or spend it on smoke, man spend it on both
Counting up this money from O or money from shows, man's counting up both
Paps need a pattern business and a pattern up home, man patternin' both
Feds draw me out for a works and smoke, tryna do me for both
They don't want me back on soc', using chips and rice, tryna pattern me both
But I'm on road, yellow ones, brown ones, I get loving from both
Money and success, just let a young nigga go govern up both
Both
Headie one
