I'm done hatin' myself for feelin'
I'm done cryin' myself awake
I've gotta leave and start the healin'
But when you move like that, I just want to stay
What have I become?
Lookin' through your phone now, oh, now
Love to you is just a game
Look what I've done
Dialing up the numbers on you
I don't want my heart to break
How do you sleep
