I know you want me
Every day, not only when you're lonely, yeah
You see, you think you know me
But you don't even know nothing about me, yeah
You see my thick thighs
Lost when you look into my brown eyes
See, my little waist can make you switch sides
You never know the devil in the disguise
So why don't you stand up, baby, and
Tell me, tell me, tell me do you want me on top?
Be honest
