Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She need something to change, need to take off the edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight (bedroom)
There's no way I can save you (save you)
Goodbyes
