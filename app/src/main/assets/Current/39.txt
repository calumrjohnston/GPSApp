Strike me a pose (ooh yeah yeah)
Girl you're kinda cute, you know (wah)
Deep on the low (where are you goin'?)
Girl you gotta loosen up (when you gonna loosen up?)
Cuz your body wanna move you know
Uptight, just loosen up
Macdaddy with the juice you know
Sippin' on a Duck-Duck-Goose you know (Goose you know)
Strike me a pose (strike it)
Girl you're kinda cute you know (yeah, yeah yeah)
Strike a pose
