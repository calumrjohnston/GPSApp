I can't live without you
I know I did you wrong, I know I did you wrong
And it's my fault, I'm sorry
I can see my whole world changing 'cause of you
It's upside down, I'm lonely
Should have known better, should have know you're my best friend
Come back here, give me one more try
I can see my whole world changing
There's no need to live if I can't be with you
What I did was wrong, I'm sorry
Sorry
