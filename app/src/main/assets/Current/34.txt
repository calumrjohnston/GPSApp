Ride it, we're all alone
Ride  it, just lose control
Ride  it, ride it, come touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
Ride it, turn the lights down low
Ride  it, from head to toe
Ride  it, ride it, touch my soul
Ride it, ride, let me feel you
It's  been a month and twenty days
And we're going 'round and 'round, playing silly games
Ride it
