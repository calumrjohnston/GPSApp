Boy, don't call me angel
You ain't got me right
Don't call me angel
You can't pay my price
Ain't from no Heaven
Yeah, you heard me right (yeah, you heard me)
Even though you know we fly (though you know we)
Don't call me angel
Uh, don't call me angel when I'm a mess
Don't call me angel when I get undressed
Don't call me angel
