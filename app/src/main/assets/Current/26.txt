Jet-plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, gettin' high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London
Yo (woo)
I do deals, but I never get twanged (twanged)
News that ain't ever been planned (planned)
Know goons that were never in gangs (gangs)
Where I'm from trap shit, get banged (what?)
Where I'm from trap shit, let a 12 gauge drip
Take me back to london
